# Data-Visualization-Project
Streamlit app project, Data Visualization, S7

Notebook:

I explored and processed the data from the two datasets "full_2019" and "full_2020".


Streamlit App:

The code is very well organized, compartmentalized and commented to allow clear readability.

For an easier navigation, use "Collapse All".

The code is structured as follows:

    1. Imports
    2. Some useful functions I declared
    3. Functions for data manipulation
    4. Functions for data visualization (cached data transformation functions + visualization functions)
    5. Main function with sequential execution of the different functions building the app.
